    "wheat_feb = \"The supply and demand outlook for 2022/23 U.S. wheat is largely unchanged this month with minor revisions to domestic use and ending stocks. Food use is lowered 2 million bushels to 975 million, which still is a record. The decrease is based on the NASS Flour Millings Products report, indicating a 2 percent reduction in wheat ground for flour for the October-December quarter compared to a year earlier. Seed use is raised 1 million bushels to 70 million, based primarily on NASS seed use data for the September-November quarter. Wheat exports are unchanged at 775 million tons with offsetting by-class changes. Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are raised 1 million bushels to 568 million. The 2022/23 season-average farm price is forecast $0.10 per bushel lower at $9.00, based on prices received to date and expectations for cash prices for the remainder of 2022/23. The global wheat outlook for 2022/23 is for increased supplies, consumption, trade, and stocks. Supplies are raised 2.4 million tons to 1,060.5 million, primarily on higher production for Australia and Russia. Australia production is raised 1.4 million tons to 38.0 million, which would be a third consecutive record. The majority of the increase is for Western Australia based on harvest receivals to date. Russia production is raised 1.0 million tons to 92.0 million on larger spring wheat harvested area. Global consumption is increased 1.4 million tons to 791.2 million, mainly on higher feed and residual use by Canada, EU, and Russia more than offsetting lower food, seed, and industrial use by Bangladesh. World trade is raised 1.3 million tons to 212.9 million on higher exports by Australia, Ukraine, EU, and Russia more than offsetting reduced exports by Canada. Projected 2022/23 ending stocks are raised 0.9 million tons to 269.3 million on increases for Australia and China more than offsetting a reduction for Ukraine. However, ending stocks still remain the lowest since 2016/17.\"\n"

      "The outlook for 2022/23 U.S. rice this month is for unchanged supplies and domestic use, lower exports, and higher ending stocks. Total rice exports are reduced 3.0 million cwt to 59.0 million on the continued sluggish pace of export sales and shipments. Total exports are now only fractionally higher than the 1985/86 exports of 58.7 million cwt, which is the last time exports declined to this level. Long-grain exports are decreased 2.0 million cwt to 45.0 million as near-record U.S. export prices continue to affect shipments to Latin America, which are being displaced by more competitively-priced rice from South American suppliers. Medium- and short-grain exports are lowered 1.0 million cwt to 14.0 million as record-high California prices are reducing Northeast Asian purchases. The decrease in exports raises 2022/23 all rice ending stocks by an equivalent amount to 36.1 million cwt, which is still 9 percent below last year. The all rice season-average farm price is unchanged at $19.40 per cwt with both the long and medium- and short-grain prices unchanged. The 2022/23 global outlook is for larger supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks. Supplies are raised 7.0 million tons to 693.3 million with virtually all of the increase on higher 2022/23 India production, which is raised 7.0 million tons to a record 132.0 million. The increase is based on the Government of India Second Advanced Estimate and the expectation the final production estimate will increase further based on recent history. World 2022/23 consumption is raised 2.8 million tons to a record 520.0 million mainly on an increase for India. Global trade is increased 0.9 million tons to 54.9 million as India exports more than offset reductions for Uruguay and the United States. Projected world ending stocks are raised 4.2 million tons to 173.3 million with China and India accounting for 81 percent of global rice stocks.\n"

    "U.S. wheat is largely unchanged this month with minor revisions to domestic use and ending stocks. Food use is lowered 2 million bushels to 975 million, which still is a record. The decrease is based on the NASS Flour Millings Products report, indicating a 2 percent reduction in wheat ground for flour for the October-December quarter compared to a year earlier. Wheat exports are unchanged at 775 million tons with offsetting by-class changes."
